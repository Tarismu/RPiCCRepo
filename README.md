Raspberry Pi Control Center Repository


The RPiCC (Raspberry Pi Control Center) will be a little Java-based Client-Server application, that allows to read
the most important data from the RPi. It will be able to execute ssh-commands and other raspberian-based
functions.

I'm doing this as a free time project so...yeah...just want to do this 4f :)
